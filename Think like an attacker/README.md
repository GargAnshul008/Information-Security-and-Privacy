# THINK LIKE AN ATTACKER
 
##The task
Pick one of the buildings on the NYU camps (or in your area) that you are authorized to access.  Walk through the building and use your observations to answer the questions below.

##Write a paragraph for each of the following questions:
1) Describe your target building
2) What security controls are in place that would stop an attacker from entering the building?
3) What security controls are in place that would detect an attacker's entry into the building?
4) Create an attack tree with at least 10 nodes that describes how you could access the building if you were not authorized to do so.

##Important

Do not trespass - only make observations in a building for which you have legitimate access
Do not try to actually bypass any security controls in the building

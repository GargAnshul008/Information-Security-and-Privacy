# PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a reference monitor and 10 test cases. The reference monitor currently fails to handle 9 of
the test cases correctly (1-9). It is your job to fix the reference monitor so it handles each of the 10 test
cases without crashing.

To get started copy each of the 10 test cases, the securitylayer.r2py file, and the run_tests.py file into
your repy RUNNABLE directory. Execute run_tests.py using Python 2, which will run each of the test
cases and produce the following output:



## Submission
Turn in an updated version of securitylayer.r2py that passes each of the test cases. Name the file
securitylayer_[netid].r2py
